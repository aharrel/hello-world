# hello-world

#This is my learning project. \n I guess you could call it my self start to programming. \n I'm not new to computers, I recently built a nice 8700k intel computer with a gtx 1070 gpu but with the data mining fiasco and surge of prices I sold it for a nice profit! \n I am on the other hand brand new to coding and networking. \n Decided to learn python as my first language and I guess this would be a good place to blog it out share what I learn and hopefully one day be able to collaberate with others my findings. \n Anyways, this project will not be anything new for you guys - atleast not anytime soon.


Edits to come soon!
